# Ticket-Selling Platform Load Balancing and Data Consistency System

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configuration files for implementing a load balancing system and ensuring data consistency across servers for a ticket-selling platform. The system is designed to handle surges in traffic during ticket releases while maintaining a seamless user experience and preventing server overload and data inconsistency issues.

## Components

### Load Balancing System

The load balancing system consists of the following components:

1. **Load Balancer**: Routes incoming traffic across multiple server instances based on predefined algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections).
2. **Server Instances**: Multiple server instances are deployed to handle incoming requests. These instances are configured identically and can scale horizontally based on traffic patterns.
3. **Monitoring and Auto-Scaling**: Monitors server health and performance metrics and dynamically adjusts the number of server instances using auto-scaling mechanisms.

### Data Consistency

To ensure data consistency across servers, the following components are implemented:

1. **Database Replication**: Utilizes master-slave replication with synchronous replication for critical data and asynchronous replication for non-critical data.
2. **Distributed Locks**: Manages concurrent writes using distributed locks or consensus algorithms to maintain data integrity across database replicas.
3. **Monitoring and Backup**: Regularly monitors database replication status, backups data, and implements disaster recovery mechanisms to recover from database failures.

## Contributing

Contributions to the ticket-selling platform load balancing and data consistency system are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request with your changes.
